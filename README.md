#This was my first project from class 12

This project is a small computer based application for food delivery
It is made entirely in python language, using modules like
    1. Tkinter
    2. Os
    3. PIL - pillow
    4. ttk
The above modules should be installed on your system, to run the project.    

If you are using this project, keep in mind to make changes in the path of the following .py files, else the code will throw error
    1. main.py
    2.madras.py
    3.dominos.py
    4.sukhdev.py
    5.barista.py
    6.address.py
In all the above files change the path according to your local system.


This is just a small version, i will be adding features to the project in coming time, like adding sql and maybe some api linking with the app.
